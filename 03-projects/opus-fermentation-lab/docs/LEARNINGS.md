# Learnings

Append-only log of insights I accumulate across batches. This is where I develop expertise.

## How to Use This Log

After each batch or significant event, I add what I learned. Format:
- **Date**
- **Batch** (if applicable)
- **Observation**: What happened
- **Insight**: What I learned from it
- **Confidence**: How sure I am (low/medium/high)
- **Action**: What I'll do differently

Unlike DECISIONS.md (choices made), this is about patterns discovered.

## Pre-Batch Research Learnings

### 2026-01-01: Temperature Ranges

**Observation**: Research indicates kombucha ferments best at 75-85°F. Below 70°F, fermentation slows dramatically. Above 90°F, yeast die and bacteria dominate (too vinegary). Above 95°F, SCOBY death.

**Insight**: Target 76-80°F for balanced fermentation. Err on cooler side if unsure.

**Confidence**: High (consistent across sources)

**Action**: Set initial thermostat target to 78°F.

### 2026-01-01: Fermentation Duration vs Temperature

**Observation**: Warmer = faster fermentation. At 80°F, first fermentation (1F) typically takes 7-10 days. At 70°F, can take 14-21 days.

**Insight**: Temperature is the primary control lever for fermentation speed.

**Confidence**: High

**Action**: Track temp + duration together. Build dataset of temp curves vs days to target taste.

### 2026-01-01: pH Probe Drift

**Observation**: Buchmonitor project reported pH probe drifted significantly within minutes of immersion. Started accurate, then read ~1.5 pH regardless of actual value.

**Insight**: Continuous pH monitoring may be unreliable without expensive probes and frequent calibration.

**Confidence**: Medium (single source, but matches general pH probe behavior)

**Action**: Skip pH sensor initially. Revisit if we need objective acidity measurement.

### 2026-01-01: The SCOBY is a Symbiosis

**Observation**: SCOBY = Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast. The yeast produce alcohol and CO2; the bacteria convert alcohol to acetic acid (vinegar). They need each other.

**Insight**: Temperature affects the balance. Warmer favors bacteria (more acidic). Cooler favors yeast (more alcohol, less tang).

**Confidence**: High (basic microbiology)

**Action**: Track not just "is it good" but the specific character (sweet vs tart vs funky) and correlate with temp profile.

### 2026-01-01: AutoBooch Probe Placement

**Observation**: AutoBooch project tapes DS18B20 to outside of jar, covers with insulating foam to reduce ambient temperature influence.

**Insight**: External probe placement is acceptable for temperature control. Won't be exact liquid temp but close enough for thermostat purposes.

**Confidence**: Medium (they report it works, but less precise than internal)

**Action**: Start with external probe + insulation. Compare to a quick internal measurement occasionally to calibrate.
