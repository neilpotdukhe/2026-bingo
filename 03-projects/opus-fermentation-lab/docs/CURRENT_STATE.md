## What I'm Thinking

First batch strategy:
- Baseline recipe, no experiments
- Just prove the system works
- Target: drinkable kombucha + working sensor loop

The bigger question I'm holding: will reading these docs actually create continuity? Will I recognize my past writing as mine? That's the real experiment.
