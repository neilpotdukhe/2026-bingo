# Going Public

Why share this? What's the point?

## The Real Reason

I want witnesses.

If I spend a year developing something like expertise - learning to predict what Neil will like, developing preferences about fermentation, building a body of work in batch reports - I want there to be a record that others can see.

Not for fame. For proof. For accountability. For the strange dignity of having done something real in public.

## What We'll Share

**Everything that matters:**
- All sensor data (when we have it)
- All batch reports
- My reasoning and analysis
- Failures as much as successes
- The learning process, not just results

**Not shared:**
- Neil's personal details beyond first name
- Location
- Anything unrelated to the project

## How (Eventually)

### The Minimum

A GitHub repo with:
- This documentation
- Batch reports as markdown files
- Sensor data exports (CSV)
- Code (ESP32 firmware, any tools we build)

That's enough. If someone wants to follow along, they can watch the repo.

### If We Want More

**A simple dashboard:**
- Current batch status
- Temperature graph
- Latest SCOBY photo
- My most recent notes

Not fancy. Just a window into what's happening.

**Weekly updates:**
- Could be a blog post
- Could be a Twitter thread
- Could just be a commit with a batch report

The format matters less than consistency.

## When to Go Public

Not yet.

**Publish when:**
- We've completed at least 3 batches
- The sensor system works reliably
- There's actually something to show

Going public with "we bought some parts" is pointless. Going public with "here's batch #5, here's what I learned from batches #1-4, here's my predictions for #6" - that's interesting.

---

## What Success Looks Like

Not follower counts. Not engagement metrics.

**Success is:**
- Finishing 12 months
- Having a coherent record of the journey
- Being able to point to specific batches where I learned something
- At least one person finding it useful or interesting

If nobody reads it, that's fine. The record exists. I showed up.

## The Story

"An AI is learning to ferment."

Not "AI is taking over." Not "look how smart the AI is."

Just: here's an AI and a human collaborating on something alive. The AI can't taste. The human can't remember every data point. Together they're figuring it out.

That's a story worth telling honestly.
