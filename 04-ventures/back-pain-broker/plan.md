## Phase 1: Validate Demand

**Goal:** 5+ real conversations. Do they pay for this?

**Actions:**
- [ ] List 20 target companies (YC startups, Series A/B, 10-50 ppl)
- [ ] Find the right contact (founder, ops, office manager)
- [ ] Send cold outreach (LinkedIn DM or email)
- [ ] Get 5+ calls booked
- [ ] Ask Gradial internally

**Outreach message:**
> "Hey—I'm exploring a service that handles employee back pain for startups. Ergonomics, movement sessions, whatever actually works. One vendor, one invoice. Would you have 15 min to share how you think about this stuff?"

**On the call, ask:**
1. Do employees complain about back/posture?
2. What do you do about it today?
3. Is it working? What's missing?
4. Would you pay someone to make this problem go away?
5. What would that need to look like?

**Listen for:** "Yes we'd pay" vs "nice to have" vs "don't care"

**Kill criteria:** Can't get 5 calls, or no one would pay.

## Phase 2: Provider Network (parallel)

Only need loose commitments:
- [ ] 2-3 yoga/stretch instructors who want corporate clients
- [ ] 1 ergonomic consultant
- [ ] 1 standing desk vendor (referral deal)

Script: "If I bring you paying corporate clients, would you work with me?"

---

## Phase 3: Pilot

- [ ] 1 company agrees to try (free or discounted)
- [ ] You assess their office + employee pain points
- [ ] Deliver first intervention
- [ ] Collect feedback

---

## Phase 4: Decide

- Did it work?
- Will they pay ongoing?
- Can you repeat?

Go or kill.
