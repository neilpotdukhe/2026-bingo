## System: How This Repo Works

**This repo is the source of truth for all goal-related context.**

### Principles
1. **Log everything relevant** - When doing research, planning, or learning something useful, add it to the goal's `plan.md` or `log.md`
2. **Prune ruthlessly** - Only keep high-signal tokens. Delete outdated info, redundant notes, and anything that's no longer actionable
3. **Actionable > Aspirational** - Plans should have concrete next steps, not vague intentions
4. **Review weekly** - Revisit active goals, update status, prune stale content

### File Structure Per Goal
```
goal-name/
├── plan.md    # Strategy, resources, phased approach
└── log.md     # Session logs, match records, progress notes
```

### When Adding Context
Ask: "Will future-me need this to make a decision or take action?"
- Yes → Add it, keep it concise
- No → Don't add it, or delete it if it exists

### Keeping Me Honest
If you notice:
- Stale plans with no recent activity
- Goals that should be in progress but aren't
- Missing context that would help execution
- Fluff that should be pruned

**Call it out.** The goal is continuous improvement, not documentation theater.
