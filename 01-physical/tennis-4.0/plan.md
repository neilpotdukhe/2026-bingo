# Tennis 4.0 Rating

**Status:** In Progress
**Target:** Achieve NTRP 4.0 rating
**Deadline:**

## Why This Matters
4.0 = solid intermediate player. Can rally consistently, has reliable strokes, understands strategy.

## Current Level
~3.0 rating

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Self-assessed or coach-verified 4.0 level
- [ ] OR official USTA rating of 4.0

## Plan

### Phase 1: Assessment & Setup (Next 2-4 weeks)
1. Book 1-2 lessons for honest assessment of weaknesses
2. Sign up for USTA PNW spring league at 3.0 level (registration deadline 2/27/26)
3. Find consistent hitting partners via Metro Seattle Tennis League

### Phase 2: Ongoing Training
- 1 lesson/week with consistent coach
- 2 match play sessions/week (league or hitting partners)
- Focus areas for 3.0 → 4.0:
  - Consistent deep groundstrokes
  - Reliable first serve
  - Net game basics
  - Point construction

### Phase 3: Intensive Academy Trip (1-2 weeks)
Consider one of these for accelerated improvement:
- **Rafa Nadal Academy (Mallorca, Spain)** - Top pick. 12 hrs tennis + 5 hrs physical prep/week. Includes sports science (nutrition, physio, cryotherapy).
- **Mouratoglou Academy (French Riviera, France)** - Great for technique/tactics + mental coaching.
- **IMG Academy (Bradenton, FL)** - World-class, less travel hassle if staying in US.
