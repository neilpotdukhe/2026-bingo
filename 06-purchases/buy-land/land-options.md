# Land Investment Plan

**Budget:** $75-100k (using $90k for planning)
**Goals:** 1) Investment returns 2) Place worth visiting
**Strategy:** Paraguay + Colombia Split
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-02

---

# THE STRATEGY

## Core Thesis

Split capital between two purposes:
1. **Paraguay** — Cash flow engine (land works for you)
2. **Colombia** — Lifestyle + appreciation (place you actually want)

This isn't diversification for its own sake. Each piece serves a specific function.

---

## Capital Allocation

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Paraguay land | $50,000 | Passive income via lease |
| Colombia coffee farm | $32,000 | Lifestyle + coffee income + appreciation |
| Legal/closing costs | $5,000 | Attorneys, title, fees (~$2.5k each country) |
| Travel | $3,000 | Two scouting trips |
| **Total** | **$90,000** | |

**If budget is $75k:** Reduce Paraguay to $40k, Colombia to $27k
**If budget is $100k:** Increase Paraguay to $55k, Colombia to $37k

---

## Paraguay: The Cash Flow Engine

### What I'm Buying
- **100-125 hectares** of cattle-ready pasture land
- Eastern Paraguay (Caaguazú, San Pedro, or Concepción departments)
- NOT the Chaco (too remote, infrastructure issues)
- Clean title, not in border zone, road access

### Target Price
- $400-500 per hectare
- Total: $40,000-62,500 for 100-125 ha

### The Income Model
Lease to local rancher for cattle grazing.

**Realistic numbers (verified from sources):**
- Lease rate: $25-35 per hectare per year
- 125 hectares × $30/ha = **$3,750/year**
- Yield on $50k investment: **7.5%**

**Conservative estimate:** $3,000/year (6%)
**Optimistic estimate:** $4,500/year (9%)

### Appreciation
- Paraguay farmland: 5-10% annual appreciation
- $50k → $55-60k after year 1
- $50k → $65-80k after 5 years

### Holding Costs
- Property tax: ~0.5-1% = $250-500/year
- **Net income after tax: $2,500-4,000/year**

### Why This Works
- Established model — foreigners have done this for 20+ years
- Law 117/91 gives foreigners same rights as locals
- Investment Grade country status (July 2024)
- Lease contracts are enforceable
- Land is appreciating as agriculture expands

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Bad title | Medium | Attorney due diligence, title search |
| Lessee default | Low | Written contract, local attorney enforcement |
| Political instability | Low | Paraguay is stable, pro-business |
| Liquidity (hard to sell) | Medium | Plan to hold 5+ years |
| Overpaying | Medium | Get 3+ property valuations |

### What I Need
1. Local attorney (non-negotiable)
2. Reputable broker (Gateway to South America, PropiedadesPY)
3. One trip to sign papers (3-4 days)
4. Lease agreement template (attorney provides)

---

## Colombia: The Soul

### What I'm Buying
- **2-4 hectare** producing coffee farm
- Risaralda, Quindío, or Caldas (Eje Cafetero)
- Existing coffee trees (3,000-8,000 trees)
- Existing workers/relationships
- Small house OR buildable land

### Target Price
- $8,000-15,000 per hectare (producing coffee land)
- Total: $25,000-45,000 for 2-4 ha

### The Income Model

**Coffee production (conservative for small farm):**
- 2-3 hectares = 4,000-8,000 trees
- Yield: 800-1,500 kg dried coffee/year
- Price: $2-4/kg (parchment coffee to local buyer)
- Gross: $2,000-5,000/year
- Costs (labor, fertilizer, processing): $1,000-2,500/year
- **Net: $1,000-2,500/year**

**Conservative estimate:** $1,000/year
**Optimistic estimate:** $2,500/year

This basically covers holding costs and gives you a free place to stay.

### Appreciation
- Coffee region: 10-15% annual appreciation
- $32k → $35-37k after year 1
- $32k → $50-65k after 5 years

### Holding Costs
- Property tax: ~0.5% = $150-200/year
- Caretaker/manager: $100-200/month if needed
- **Coffee income covers costs** — net neutral to slightly positive

### Why This Works
- You get a PLACE — somewhere you actually want to go
- 4-5 hour flight from US (not 8+ like Portugal)
- Perfect climate (65-75°F year-round)
- World-class natural beauty
- Warm, genuine people
- Option to build Airbnb cabin later ($15-25k) for $10-20k/year additional income
- $93k+ investment = renewable residency visa

### The Real Value
This isn't primarily about income. This is about:
- Having somewhere meaningful to go
- Building relationships in another country
- Optionality for future (Airbnb, more land, residency)
- An asset that appreciates while you use it

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Farm mismanagement | Medium | Visit annually, build relationship with workers |
| Coffee price crash | Low-Medium | Not dependent on max profit, covers costs |
| Title issues | Low | Attorney due diligence |
| Security | Low | Coffee region is safe, verify specific location |
| Can't find good property at budget | Medium | Be patient, expand search area |

### What I Need
1. Local attorney (non-negotiable)
2. Broker who knows small farms (Coffee Country Real Estate)
3. Scouting trip (4-5 days)
4. Spanish helps but not required (brokers speak English)

## Alternative Approach: Sequential (Lower Risk)

If you want to reduce risk of making two mistakes at once:

### Year 1: Colombia First ($55k)
1. Buy a slightly larger/better coffee farm
2. Visit 2x to build relationships
3. Validate you actually love it
4. Keep $35k in reserve

### Year 2: Deploy to Paraguay ($35k)
1. With Colombia working, add Paraguay for cash flow
2. Now you have more knowledge and confidence
3. Smaller Paraguay position but still meaningful

**Pros:** Lower risk, more learning before full commitment
**Cons:** Less diversification initially, miss some Paraguay appreciation

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Paraguay
- Seller can't produce clear title history
- Property in "border zone" (50km from borders with Brazil/Argentina/Bolivia)
- Land has indigenous claims or disputes
- Price significantly below market (too good = something wrong)
- Broker pressures quick decision
- No option to meet potential lessees

### Colombia
- Farm has no production history to verify
- Workers seem unhappy or evasive
- Seller won't allow soil/tree inspection
- Property in insecure area (verify with attorney)
- No clear water rights
- Coffee trees look unhealthy (yellow leaves, disease)

---

## Decision Checklist

Before wiring any money:

**Paraguay:**
- [ ] Attorney has verified clean title
- [ ] Property is NOT in border zone
- [ ] I have seen property in person (or trusted representative has)
- [ ] Lease agreement is drafted with specific lessee
- [ ] I understand all closing costs
- [ ] I have 2+ comparable sales showing fair price

**Colombia:**
- [ ] Attorney has verified clean title
- [ ] I have visited property in person
- [ ] I have met the workers who will manage it
- [ ] I understand the harvest cycle and income timing
- [ ] I have seen production records (if available)
- [ ] I have a management arrangement documented

---

## Worst Case Scenarios

### Paraguay worst case:
- Land has title issues → lose investment
- Mitigation: thorough attorney due diligence
- Realistic worst case: lessee defaults, takes 6-12 months to find new one, lose 1 year income (~$3k)

### Colombia worst case:
- Farm manager steals harvest
- Mitigation: visit annually, build relationship, use trusted broker referrals
- Realistic worst case: bad harvest year, make $0 income but land still appreciates

### Combined worst case:
- Both investments underperform
- Still own $85k in land that's likely worth $85-100k
- Downside is limited — land doesn't go to zero

---

- [ ] Both properties purchased and titled in my name
- [ ] Paraguay: lease signed, first payment received

## Country Research Archive

[Previous country-by-country analysis preserved below for reference]

---

## Honest Assessment — Why Not Other Countries

### Portugal (Alentejo)
Good value, not elite. Interior is remote and hot. Real action is on coast at €300k+. Fine for EU foothold but not worth the flight for occasional visits.

### Ecuador (Vilcabamba)
Cheap and pleasant, wrong crowd. Expat community skews conspiracy-minded retirees. Young interesting people aren't there.

### Panama (Boquete)
Retirement community. If you're under 60, boring. "Florida retirees who wanted cooler weather."

### Costa Rica (Southern Zone)
Beautiful but budget-stretched. $75-100k gets you inland jungle, not ocean view.

### Mexico (Oaxaca)
Genuinely cool but complicated. Fideicomiso hassle, ejido land risks, due diligence critical.

### Uruguay
Elite exists but not at this budget. José Ignacio is billionaire territory.

### Argentina (Patagonia)
Stunning but risky and far. Currency instability, ownership caps, 12+ hours travel.

### USA (NM/TX)
Easy to own, not exciting. Desert scrubland, low appreciation.
