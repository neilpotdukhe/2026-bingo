# Land Investment Plan

**Status:** In Progress — Emails sent, awaiting broker responses
**Budget:** $75-100k (using $90k for planning)
**Goals:** 1) Investment returns 2) Place worth visiting
**Strategy:** Paraguay + Colombia Split
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-02

---

## Core Thesis

Split capital between two purposes:
1. **Paraguay** — Cash flow engine (land works for you)
2. **Colombia** — Lifestyle + appreciation (place you actually want)

---

## Capital Allocation

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Paraguay land | $50,000 | Passive income via lease |
| Colombia coffee farm | $32,000 | Lifestyle + coffee income + appreciation |
| Legal/closing costs | $5,000 | Attorneys, title, fees (~$2.5k each country) |
| Travel | $3,000 | Two scouting trips |
| **Total** | **$90,000** | |

**If budget is $75k:** Reduce Paraguay to $40k, Colombia to $27k
**If budget is $100k:** Increase Paraguay to $55k, Colombia to $37k

---

## Paraguay: The Cash Flow Engine

### Target
- **100-125 hectares** cattle-ready pasture
- Eastern Paraguay (Caaguazú, San Pedro, or Concepción)
- NOT the Chaco (too remote)
- Clean title, not in border zone, road access
- **Price:** $400-500/ha → $50k total

### Income Model
- Lease to rancher: $25-35/ha/year
- 125 ha × $30 = **$3,750/year** (7.5% yield)
- After property tax (~$300/year): **$3,000-3,500/year net**

### Appreciation
- 5-10%/year → $65-80k value in 5 years

### Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Bad title | Attorney due diligence |
| Lessee default | Written contract, attorney enforcement |
| Liquidity | Plan to hold 5+ years |

---

## Colombia: The Soul

### Target
- **2-4 hectares** producing coffee farm
- Risaralda, Quindío, or Caldas (Eje Cafetero)
- Existing trees (3,000-8,000), existing workers
- Small house OR buildable land
- **Price:** $8-15k/ha → $32k total

### Income Model
- 800-1,500 kg coffee/year × $2-4/kg = $2-5k gross
- Costs: $1-2.5k/year
- **Net: $1,000-2,500/year** (covers holding costs)

### Appreciation
- 10-15%/year → $50-65k value in 5 years

### Real Value
Not primarily about income. It's about:
- Having somewhere meaningful to go
- Optionality (Airbnb later, residency path at $93k+)
- An asset that appreciates while you use it

### Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Farm mismanagement | Visit annually, build relationships |
| Coffee price crash | Not dependent on max profit |
| Title issues | Attorney due diligence |

---

## Combined Projections

### Year 1
| Source | Conservative | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Paraguay (income + appreciation) | $5,000 | $9,000 |
| Colombia (income + appreciation) | $3,700 | $6,800 |
| **Total return** | **$8,700 (10%)** | **$15,800 (19%)** |

### Year 5
- **Portfolio value:** $130-160k
- **Total income received:** $15-25k
- **Plus:** A place you genuinely want to visit
